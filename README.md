# SteamJump
My computer graphics semester project. This small game is a sidescolling platformer with additional two types of movement physics. 

WASD are normal working and jumping. Arrow keys send “steam” out in the direction of the arrow. The arrow keys give the player the ability to move while in the air, but add to the sore (which is bad).

The goal of the game is to make it to the end of the level as fast as possible, while using as little steam as possible. The lower the player’s score, the better the player did.
